\subsection{Exchange rates}\label{sec:Exchange rates}
The price of one currency in terms of another is called an exchange rate. Exchange rates allows to compare prices of goods and services across countries. Exchange rates determine a country's relative prices of exports and imports.

Lets name $\euro$ the home currency and $\lira$ the  foreign currency, then \[E^{\frac{\euro}{\lira}}=\frac{X \euro}{Y \lira}\] is the exchange rate in direct quotation (Preisnotierung) and \[E^{\frac{\lira}{\euro}}=\frac{Y \lira}{X \euro}\] is the exchange rate in indirect quotation (Mengennotierung). 

\boxb{
	\paragraph{Conventions to talk about exchange rates:}
	\itex{
		\item \textit{``Euro to Dollar''} means \euro/\textdollar\ (This is especially confusing and it can also be understood the other way round but the first currency mentioned is \textit{usually} interpreted as the numerator)
		\item \textit{``Euro per Dollar''} means \euro/\textdollar
		\item \textit{``Euro in Dollar''} means \textdollar/\euro
		\item \textit{``1 Euro costs X Dollars''} means X (\textdollar/\euro)
	}
}
\pbn

Both rates contain the same information, but have different interpretations: \itex{\item $E^{\frac{\euro}{\lira}}$ tells that we have to give X \euro\ to receive Y \lira, whereas \item $E^{\frac{\lira}{\euro}}$ tells that we have to give Y \lira\ to receive X \euro. }

Alternative interpretations: \itex{
	\item $E^{\frac{\euro}{\lira}}$ tells that we have to give $\frac{X}{Y} \euro$ to receive 1 \lira, whereas 
	\item $E^{\frac{\lira}{\euro}}$ tells that we have to give $\frac{Y}{X} \lira$ to receive 1 \euro.} 

\heux{Appreciation / Depreciation}{
	A currency can appreciate or depreciate relative to other currencies.
	\itex{\item If the \euro\ appreciates, $E^{\frac{\euro}{\lira}}$ decreases and $E^{\frac{\lira}{\euro}}$ increases.
		\item If the \euro\ depreciates, $E^{\frac{\euro}{\lira}}$ increases and $E^{\frac{\lira}{\euro}}$ decreases.
	}
}

\pbn
\subsection{Relative prices}
\itex{
	\item How much `value' do I have to give to receive a `value' from abroad?
	\item Assume the home country produces beer and the foreign country produces wine. Further assume you want to exchange a beer for wine, then the relative price gives the amount of beer you have to give to receive a unit of wine (in the direct quotation), or the amount of wine you receive for a unit of beer (indirect quotation).
	\item A relative price of 1 can mean, for example, that you can exchange 1 litre of beer with 1 litre of wine. However, we could also assume that beer is measured in cans of 500ml each and wine in 1 litre bottles. Then, the relative price would be \[P^{\frac{beer}{wine}}= \frac{2 \textnormal{ beer}}{1 \textnormal{ wine}}.\]
	That means, you can convert 2 cans of beer for one bottle of wine.
	\item If the relative prices increase, I must give more beer to receive a wine.
	\item If the relative prices decrease, I must give less beer to receive a wine.
}


\subsection{Exchange rates and relative prices}
\itex{
	\item Relative prices are (directly) determined by exchange rates.
	\item To proof this statement, assume an exchange rate of 1, $E^{\frac{\lira}{\euro}}=E^{\frac{\euro}{\lira}}=1$ and that
	a litre of beer costs 1 \euro\ at home and a wine costs 1 \lira\ abroad.
	\item Thus, I can buy both a wine or a beer for 1 \euro. Due to the fact that I must pay the wine producer with \lira, I must exchange the \euro\ beforehand. The process goes like this:\\
	
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		[
		% Einstellungen
		node distance=0.75cm and 1cm,
		rounded corners,
		font=\small,
		>=stealth'
		]
		% Knoten
		\node[draw, rectangle, align=center] (top) { exchange 1 \euro\  };
		\node[draw, rectangle, right =of top] (yes) { $1\euro \cdot 1 \frac{\lira}{\euro} = 1 \lira$ };
		%\node[draw, rectangle, below right=of top] (no) { No };
		\node[draw, rectangle, right =of yes] (doit) { buy  wine };
		\node[draw, rectangle, right =of doit] (wine) {$1\lira \cdot 1 \frac{\textnormal{wine}}{\lira}=1 \textnormal{ wine }$ };
		\draw[->] (top)-- (yes) ;
		\draw[->] (doit) -- (wine);
		\draw[->] (yes) -- (doit);
	\end{tikzpicture}\\
	
	
	
	\item Now, assume that the \euro\ appreciates and the exchange rate becomes $E^{\frac{\euro}{\lira}}=0.5$ and $E^{\frac{\lira}{\euro}}=2$, respectively. \\
	
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		[
		% Einstellungen
		node distance=0.75cm and 1cm,
		rounded corners,
		font=\small,
		>=stealth'
		]
		
		% Knoten
		\node[draw, rectangle, align=center] (top) { exchange 1 \euro\  };
		\node[draw, rectangle, right =of top] (yes) { $1\euro \cdot 2 \frac{\lira}{\euro} = 2 \lira$ };
		%\node[draw, rectangle, below right=of top] (no) { No };
		\node[draw, rectangle, right =of yes] (doit) { buy  wine };
		\node[draw, rectangle, right =of doit] (wine) {$2\lira \cdot 1 \frac{\textnormal{wine}}{\lira}=2 \textnormal{ wine }$ };
		\draw[->] (top)-- (yes) ;
		\draw[->] (doit) -- (wine);
		\draw[->] (yes) -- (doit);
	\end{tikzpicture}\\
	
	
	\item Indeed, exchange rates determine the relative prices. If the home currency appreciates (depreciates), buying goods and services abroad becomes relative cheaper (more expensive).
	
	\item Of course, if many people now buy wine and aim to convert \euro\ to \lira, this may impact the exchange rate and the price of wine. We come back to that later.

\heux{Exchange rates and international trade}{The exchange rate determines the relative price of commodities across countries. For example, an appreciation of a currency makes commodities more expensive for foreign buyers and in turn makes foreign commodities cheaper for buyers at home.}




\subsection{Trump and relative prices}
Let's return to Trump's Twitter message. Steel producers in the US (and with them Donald Trump) are not happy about a strong dollar (and a weak lira), because it makes their products relatively expensive for Turkish buyers and Turkish steel relatively cheap for US consumers. 
Trump would have two options to change this situation: He could change the exchange rates or the relative prices of goods in different countries. Since it is difficult for him to influence the exchange rate (the central bank is independent), he decided to increase tariffs and thus the price of foreign steel in the United States. However, this has the disadvantage of making U.S. consumers pay more for these goods (and for goods made from and with steel and aluminum), as David Boaz, executive vice president of the Cato Institute, an American libertarian think tank, notes in his response on Twitter, see \autoref{fig:trump_reply}. 

In addition, it can be argued that the increased tariffs will make the dollar even stronger because buyers who no longer purchase steel in Turkey due to the increased tariffs will no longer seek to exchange U.S. dollars for Turkish lira. 

Overall, it can be doubted that raising tariffs is a successful strategy.

\subsection{The foreign exchange market (FOREX)}\label{sec:FOREX}

At a market, people come together to exchange something. In short, everyone offers something to receive something in return. On the FOREX, the players exchange currencies. As in any market, the price is determined by supply and demand (of currencies):

\subsubsection{The vehicle currency}
\itex{
	\item The average value of traded currencies are about \textdollar 5.1 trillion per day (April 2016).\footnote{See: \url{www.bis.org/publ/rpfx16.htm}}
	\item As \autoref{fig:most_cur} shows, about 30-25\% of all currency transactions involve the \euro\ and almost 90\% of all currency transactions involve the \textdollar.
	%	\item That means, the world economy is dominated by the US-\textdollar\ being accepted in the
	%	exchange of goods and assets among countries. Thus, the dollar acts as a `vehicle currency' in the sense that most exchange activities indirectly involve the US-\textdollar\ rather than directly exchange two other currencies. A vehicle currency is desirable when there are high
	%	transactions costs of exchange.
	\item For example, assume you want to exchange currency A to B. Now, imagine you can either exchange currency A directly to B, or indirectly by convering currency A to the US-\textdollar\ and US-\textdollar\ to currency B. Then, going the indirect way using the US-\textdollar\ as a vehicle can be cheaper, when the direct transaction is more expensive than the two indirect transactions.

\section{Purchasing power parity assumption}\label{sec:Purchasing power parity assumption}
The Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Assumption is also know as the `law of one price'. It says that in competitive markets with zero transportation costs  and no trade barriers, identical goods, $i$, have the same price, $P^i_{c}$, all over the world when expressed in terms of the same currency, $c$.

The idea behind this is that if prices differences would exist, profits could be made through arbitrage, that is, the process of buying a good cheap in country A the selling the good with a profit in country B. This process can quickly equalize real price differences across countries.

However, in the real world, prices differ substantially across countries (see Big Mac Index below) for several reasons. In particular, the strong assumptions of the PPP do not hold, some goods and services are not trade-able and firms might have different degrees of market power across countries.
