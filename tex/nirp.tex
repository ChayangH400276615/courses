\frame{\frametitle{Short Description}	In recent years, the European Central Bank (ECB) and some other central banks engaged in a radical new policy experiment by setting negative policy rates. This course discusses whether negative interest rates policy (NIRP) is an effective tool for stimulating aggregate demand and hence keep prices at a stable inflation of 2\%. In particular, I present aggregate and bank-level data to document that once the policy rate turns negative the pass-through to deposit and lending rates seems to be limited.

	I was about 10 year old and my passion was to collect stamps when I discovered an interesting stamp in an album, I received as a gift. I curiously asked my dad if I am a double millionaire now (see \autoref{fig:stamp}). Unfortunately, he had to disappoint me. However, I've learned that\\ \textbf{(lesson 1) a currency can vanish and their value is not fixed over time.}}
	
\frame{\scriptsize From the year 2002 onwards, the \textit{Deutsche Post} refused to accept all my mint stamps that are denoted in \textit{Pfennig}. Thus, I've learned that\\ 
	\textbf{(lesson 2) currencies reforms can happen without war or hyperinflation and that some assets can somehow loose parts of their value}. 
	
	Even the \textit{EZB stamp} with Euro banknotes is worth sending a letter today. And even it would be accepted by the \textit{Deutsche Post},  the 110 Pfennig wouldn't be enough. Today, it costs 156 Pfennig or 80 Cent to send a letter. THat means, the sending a letter became about 40 percent more expensive. Thus, I have learned that\\ \textbf{(lesson 3) inflation still exists.}}
	
\frame{\scriptsize	Nowadays, I stopped buying stamps and follow the advise of my parents: ``bring your money to a bank and  become rich through deposit rates''. 
	I wonder if this is still valid strategy in times where 
	\textbf{(lesson 4) the ECB and some other central banks set negative policy rates.} 
	
	For a long a long time that was unthinkable because economist believed in the so-called \textit{Zero Lower Bound (ZLB)}, that is, the widely shared notion that a NIRP is useless. The argument was that private banks cannot charge negative deposit rates because if they do so, people would prefer to store their cash privately and hence, decreasing interest rates below zero would not happen. Again, my investigations showed that the arguments of the 
	\textbf{(lesson 5) Zero Lower Bound (ZLP) needs to be re-evaluated.} }

\frame{\scriptsize
	In particular, I found out that actually 115 out of sample of 1200 German banks do indeed charge negative deposit rates. Thus,\\
	\textbf{(lesson 6) negative policy rates can pass-through to negative deposit rates.} 
	
	It has to be said, however, that banks charge negative rates only for a tiny circle of people because most banks set negative rates only on \textit{individual arrangement}, only for firms, or only for (short term) assets above 100-500 thousand Euros.}

\frame{\frametitle{Outline of the lecture}	
	In this short lecture, I will thrive the following questions:
	\itex{
		\item What is the objective of ECB's NIRP?
		\item How can ECB's NIRP effect economies?
		\item What is so special on a NIRP from a macroeconomic perspective?
		\item Can negative central bank policy rates transmit into negative deposit rates or into negative lending interest rate (the cost of debt for the borrower)?
		\item The key question for macroeconomic monetary policy (and this lecture) is therefore whether lowering interest rates below zero can be an effective tool for stimulating aggregate demand.
		\item What are the cons of a NIRP?

%\section{The rudimentary economics of ECB's policy rates}

\frame{\frametitle{ECB: Objectives and achievements}
	The primary objective of the ECB is to maintain price stability within the Eurozone, that is, an inflation\footnote{Inflation is an increase in the general price level of goods and services. When there is inflation in an economy, the value of money decreases because a given amount will buy fewer goods and services than before.} of under 2\%. In particular, the goal is to have ``a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)\footnote{The HICP is a weighted average of consumer price indices of member states who have adopted the euro.} for the euro area of below 2\%''\footnote{see: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/strategy/pricestab/html/index.en.html}. Moreover, the ECB ``shall support the general economic policies in the Union'' (see Article 127(1) TFEU).
}
	
	\frame{\frametitle{}
		In the figure below, I present inflation rates and inflation expectations from 1990 onwards. The figure shows, inflation rate circulated more or less around the 2\% and that this holds, although the Eurozone was hit by some serious economic turbulences in the last decades. Thus, we can say that the ECB was successful in achieving their main objective. }
	
	%The question now is: How did they do it?

\frame{\frametitle{Monetary policy instruments}\scriptsize
	In recent years, the ECB has deployed an innovative, multi-pronged approach in the design of its policy stance. In a nutshell, the current policy mix basically includes four elements: (i) pushing the policy rate into negative territory, (ii) forward guidance on the future policy path, (iii) the asset purchase programmes, and (iv) the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). Importantly, these measures work as a package, with significant complementarities across the different instruments. However, we do not aim discuss these instruments here. Instead, we focus on the most recognized instrument, that is, the central bank interest/policy rate (CBPR). }
	
	\frame{\frametitle{Central bank interest/policy rate (CBPR)}
		
	\blox{Eureka}{When people talk about the \textbf{central bank interest/policy rate (CBPR)} they usually refer to the deposit facility rate, which is actually one of the three interest rates\footnote{The other two are called marginal lending facility rate, main refinancing operation rate.} the ECB sets every six weeks. The rate defines the interest banks receive for depositing money with the central bank overnight. }
}

\frame{\frametitle{The textbook economics of the CBPR}\scriptsize
	All major introductory macroeconomic textbooks assume that investments increase when interest rates decrease and vice versa. This \textit{investment function} is shown in panel (a) of the figure below. An increase of investments transmits into higher aggregate demand and output through the IS curve as illustrated in Mankiw's macroeconomics textbook.\footnote{For simplicity, I refrain from discussing the LM curve which closes the IS-LM model and  is used to determined equilibrium in the money market.} It doesn't need a formal model to understand that higher aggregate demand and output yields higher prices.}

}
	
	\frame{\frametitle{}	\scriptsize
	However, most textbooks refrain from discussing how the investment function behaves when interest rates become close to zero or even negative. The reason is that NIRP was unthinkable for a long time as a quote of Warren Buffet shows:
	
	\begin{quotation}
		``Whats happened with interest rates is really extraordinary. I mean, you can go back and read everything, Keynes, Adam Smith, Ricardo, Galbraith, Paul Samuelson, or you name. You won't see a word in my view anything I've ever seen about sustained negative interest rates. I mean, we are doing something the world hasn't seen.'' Warren Buffet in an CNBC interview 2016 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q862lngj034)
	\end{quotation} 
}
	
		\frame{\frametitle{}\scriptsize
	Instead, the so-called \textbf{Zero Lower Bound (ZLB)} was dominant. It says that a short-term nominal interest rate of zero cause a liquidity trap and limit the capacity of central banks to stimulate economic growth. The main argument is that it is difficult to encourage investors to deposit money at zero or negative interest rates. Thus, economist thought that central banks will not reduce interest rates below this bound. As already mentioned, they were wrong. 
	
	\blox{Eureka}{We should re-investigate the investment function. As NIRP exists, we should discuss whether NIRP is an effective tool for stimulating investments and increase prices.} }
	
		\frame{\frametitle{}\scriptsize
	Basically, four ways exist how NIRP can increase investments:
	\enux{\item Banks can lend more to households and companies, rather than holding on to cash, which has now become costly.
		\item Businesses can invest more, as funding investment is now cheaper.
		\item Households could save less, or borrow to spend more.
		\item Demand for the currency could fall. This might lead to a depreciation of the currency, an increase in the price of imported goods and growing demand for the country’s exports which are now cheaper for foreign buyers.
	}\smallskip
	
	If we abstract from the fourth way, the effectiveness of NIRP hinges on whether the policy rates pass-through to deposit and lending rates. 
	In the next box, I will present the work of \cite{Eggertsson2017Are} to answer that question. }

}

\frame{\frametitle{Limited Pass-Through to Deposit Rates}\scriptsize
	On page \pageref{fig:deposit}, I plot aggregate deposit rates for six economic areas in which the policy rate is negative. The red vertical lines mark the month in which policy rates became negative. The Swedish central bank lowered its key policy rate below zero in February 2015. Deposit rates, which in Sweden are usually below the policy rate, did not follow the central bank rate into negative territory. Instead, deposit rates for both households and firms remain stuck at, or just above, zero. A similar picture emerges for Denmark who crossed the ZLB twice. As was in Sweden, the negative policy rate has not been transmitted to deposit rates.
	The deposit rates of Switzerland  and Japan were already very low for some time when the ZLB was passed. However, even then the other rates did not follow the policy rate into negative territory.
	
	The ECB hit the ZLB in June 2014. As aggregate deposit rates are high in the Euro Area and therefore have more room to fall before reaching the zero lower bound. Moreover, the deposit rate does not normally follow the policy rate as closely as in the other cases. One reason for this is the heterogeneity of the Euro Area. Looking at Germany only, a similar pattern emerges as in the other cases. That is, despite negative policy rates, the deposit rate appears bounded by zero. }
	
\frame{	\blox{Eureka}{Limited Pass-Through to Deposit Rates. Overall, the presented aggregate evidence indicates that the impact of policy rates on deposit rates was limited and is strongly suggestive of a lower bound on deposit rates }}

}

\frame{\frametitle{Limited Pass-Through to Lending Rates}\scriptsize
	In \autoref{fig:lending}, I plot lending rates for the six economic areas with negative policy rates. While lending
	rates usually follow the policy rate closely, there appears to be a disconnect once the policy
	rate breaks the ZLB. Lending rates in Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland seem less sensitive to the respective policy rates once they become negative. 
	The Euro Area is somewhat of an outlier, as lending rates appear to have decreased. This is not surprising in light of the higher-than-zero deposit rates I document above. Again, for the case of
	Germany, in which the zero lower bound on the deposit rate is binding, lending rates appear
	less responsive.}

		\note{Source: \cite{Eggertsson2017Are}.}
	\end{center}}
	
\frame{\scriptsize	To investigate the behavior of banks with respect to lending rates further, I present daily bank-level data for thirteen Swedish credit institutions in \autoref{fig:ilending}.
	In the left panel, the bank-level mortgage rates for thirteen banks or credit institutions are plotted. The first two dashed lines capture policy rate reductions in positive territory. On both occasions, there is an immediate and homogeneous decline in bank lending rates. The same holds true when the policy rate passes the ZLB (solid line). Around the three proceeding dashed lines, which represent reductions in negative territory, the bank lending rates are strikingly different: While there is some initial reduction in lending rates, most of the rates increase again shortly thereafter. Thus, the total impact on lending rates seems to be limited. Moreover, there is a substantial increase in dispersion, with several banks keeping their lending rate roughly unchanged despite repeated interest rate reductions below zero. 
	
	In the right panel the minimum and maximum bank lending rate are plotted, along with the policy rate (the dashed black line). The increase in dispersion after the policy rate turned negative is clearly visible. It is remarkably that the minimum bank lending rate has stayed constant since the first quarter of 2015, despite three policy rate reductions in negative territory.}
	
	
\frame{\blox{Eureka}{Limited Pass-Through to Lending Rates. 	While the evidence is not as clear as for deposit rates, the impact of policy rates on lending rates seems to be limited once the ZLB has passed. Moreover, the dispersion of lending rates within a territory was increased when the policy rate was negative and some banks even increased (!) their lending rates when the policy rate was negative.}}

}

\frame{\frametitle{Does NIRP work?}\scriptsize
	Overall, there is a lack of research that evaluates the impact of NIRP empirically. Considering the fact that NIRP is a rather new phenomena, that is not a big surprise. Moreover, the NIRP is hard to evaluate as there is no counterfactual and the policy rate instrument is just one out of many monetary instruments that have been used by the ECB in recent years. Thus, it is hard to find an empirical identification strategy that allows a sort of ceteris paribus interpretation.
	
	The ECB was heavily criticized for the NIRP. While I cannot list all points of scepticism, I'd like to mention some reasonable ones here: 
	\itex{
		\item Private banks cannot pass through negative interest rates to their customer. That lowers the profitability of private banks which are likely to raise lending rates to save their interest margin. We saw this in Sweden where banks increased rates for mortgages and loans to stay profitable. Of course, this weakens policy effectiveness. 
		\item If lending rates become very low, more risky investments get financed which, in turn, brings economic uncertainties to the market.
		\item Finally, a NIRP may harm the reputation of the Euro because people may flee into other (financial) assets or alternative currencies like bitcoins.

\frame{\frametitle{Sparkassen CEO criticizes the ECB policy}\scriptsize
	Printed below, you find an open letter from the Sparkassen-CEO Helmut Schleweis to the ECB president Mario Draghi published in the BILD Zeitung a week ago. Read it and try to answer or discuss the following questions:
	\enux{
		\item Name the main objective of the ECB.
		\item Discuss what Mr. Schleweis wants the ECB to take care of.
		\item Comment on the following statement ``Anyone who invests money with you must even pay something.'' In particular, discuss who `invests' money in the ECB.
		\item High interest rates are ususally good for those who have money and bad for those who want to borrow money, right? Moreover, believing in the words of Mr. Schleweis, those who have money can flee `into real estate with their money' in cases where interest rates are low. Having that in mind, isn't it that those who have money always win? 
		\item The ECB set negative interest rates primarily to increase aggregate demand and prices. Discuss if Europe would `move closer' or if some states would `reduce their debts' faster with high interest rates and deflation.

	Dear Mario Draghi,
	
	First and foremost, allow us to state that we have great respect for the difficult task you face in keeping the euro stable and Europe united.
	
	However, what you are doing is wrong. For years, you have been throwing more and more money at the market. You have abolished the interest rate. And you have loaned money in unimaginable dimensions to states that are highly indebted.
	
	By doing this, you are gradually changing Europe, Germany, and the lives of millions of people – not for the better, but, in the long term, for the worse. It no longer costs anything to take on debts. Saving money no longer generates any interest. Anyone who invests money with you must even pay something.
	
	You are thereby turning the rules of the economy upside down. People who are able to are fleeing into real estate with their money – prices and rents for which are on the rise. The retirement provisions of millions of people are melting like snow in the sun. Social insurances, pension funds, and foundations are all losing great amounts of money every day, and thus losing their capacities. For years, we have taught Germany’s children that saving money makes sense, because one has to provide for bad times during crises. You are undermining that culture. All of this cannot end well in the long term.
	
	And what is it all for? Have European states that are in a crisis used the bought time to reduce their debts? Has Europe moved closer together? Your monetary policy has achieved none of this.
	
	If one is in a dead-end street, one should not increase the speed. It is time to turn around – step by step. Now!
	
	Best wishes,
	Helmut Schleweis
